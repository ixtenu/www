README
======

This is the repository for the following site: <https://ixtenu.neocities.org/>

Dependencies
------------

- Unix utilities (sh, find, sed, grep, etc.)
- pandoc <https://pandoc.org/>
- HTML Tidy <https://www.html-tidy.org/>

Building
--------

Run the "build" shell script, which takes no arguments.

Directories
-----------

- public: Output directory for the build script.  This is the directory that
  would be uploaded to web server.
- content: The Markdown sources for the site content.  The *.md files in this
  directory are made into HTML pages with pandoc(1).  Subdirectories are
  preserved.  Files whose names don't end with *.md are ignored.
- static: Files copied verbatim into public/.
- layouts: HTML fragments used with pandoc(1).

Loosely based on the directory structure used by Hugo (a static site
generator with many more features than the homegrown script used by this
repository).
